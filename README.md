### glpaint
A high performance opengl paint libraray

glpaint is a high performance paint library for data visualization. I build this library because most of exsit plot library have an poor render performance like gnuplot. By directly render via OpenGL, glpaint is more flexable and have a high performance. I think it helpful for most data visualization task.
