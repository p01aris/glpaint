### glpaint
A high performance opengl paint libraray

glpaint is a high performance data plotting library for data visualization. I build this library because most exsit plotting library have a poor render performance like gnuplot. By directly rendering via OpenGL, glpaint is more flexable and have a high performance. I think it helpful for most data visualization task.
